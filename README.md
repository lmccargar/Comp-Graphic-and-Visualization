**How do I approach designing software?**

GLFW keyboard mapping is a skill which gave good controls over the scene. OpenGL with GLFW and GLEW libraries. The tactics used during this design approach could not be applied to future work. The exception is the tactics used with GLFW library. This library has relevance with current 3d design work. The lessons learned in this course is what not to do when developing using 3d graphics libraries in a professional work setting.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

There were no new development strategies to use while working the scene. The technology mainly worked if the project was x86. I could only reply on using older antiquated development strategies in order to make the scene work. There were times iteration factored into the development. Much of the iteration had to do with building the 3d objects in the scene. Also, when checking if an object is needed or should be destroyed. The course tutorials helped with improving my C++ coding. But what really helped was having to trial and error, searching stack over flow during the trial and error phases. Buying a Udemy course was what helped me the most in completing this project and course.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

My goals in computer science is to be a highly knowledgeable and competent software engineer. Up until this course, SNHU has done well to ensure I meet my goals with their courses. But this course is the exception in this school. CS-330-T2653 Comp Graphic and Visualization 21EW2 was a dismal failure, it started being chaotic with the second module with two different configuration settings which caused a multitude of link errors. The lecturer was using version OpenGL 3.3 and the course tutorials used OpenGL 4.4. The lecturer hard coded all the libraries, which I have personally seen developers get fired for hard coding library paths, just like the lecturer did. The use of deprecated libraries throughout the course. There is no good future pathways educationally and professionally obtained from this course.
